During my Project  internship, I worked on a project that aimed to make it easier to handle large amounts of legal documents. Lawyers and other legal professionals often need to read and summarize lengthy documents, which can be very time-consuming and prone to errors. To help with this, I focused on using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically summarize these documents
My work involved several steps:
Data Collection and Preparation: I gathered various legal documents and prepared them for analysis by cleaning the text and breaking it down into manageable parts.
Choosing and Training Models: I tested different NLP models to find the best one for summarizing the documents. This included both basic methods and more advanced techniques like those used in modern AI models.
Evaluating and Improving: I developed ways to measure how well the summaries captured the important information from the original documents and made adjustments to improve the results.
This project helped me understand the complexities of legal language and how to use technology to make summarizing documents faster and more accurate. It was a valuable experience that showed me the practical applications of NLP and how it can solve real-world problems.
